            <h1>hi developers!</h1>
            <h2>we are trying to make internboat happen.</h2>

            <h3>why did dis? (purpose)</h3>
            <p>internships take forever to apply to when you have to access each company website and fill out all their forms, over and over and over. we wanted to make this easy by localizing all the applications in one place.</p>

            <h3>how do dat? (structural process)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>html | for front-end development</li>
                <li>css | for making it not ugly</li>
                <li>javascript | for writing the program back-end</li>
                <li>firebase auth | for storing user data</li>
                <li>firebase database | for storing application data</li>
                <li>web scraping | to get additional application requirements</li>
            </ul>
